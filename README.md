## Software
We have obtained the Bitcoin OHLC dataset from Kaggle.
To extract insights from this dataset, we will be using Python along with the PySpark library. We may also use Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize our results.
Additionally, SQL will be inputted as parameters in certain PySpark functions to filter the dataframe.
