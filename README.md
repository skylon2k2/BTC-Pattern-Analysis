# BTC-Pattern-Analysis

## Purpose
There are various chart patterns that are used by traders to maximize profits from the stock market.
We would like to determine if these chart patterns can be utilized when trading cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin.
This will be done through a variety of data manipulation methods with the use of software.

## Software
We have obtained the Bitcoin OHLC dataset from Kaggle.
To extract insights from this dataset, we will be using Python along with the PySpark library. We may also use Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize our results.
Additionally, there will be SQL inputted as parameters in certain PySpark functions to filter the dataframe.
